### Trace Levels
```
trace 0-5
```
Use of the `--level` (`-l`) flag is optional but recommended.

| **Option** | **Description** |
|:-----------|:----------------|
| `0` | trace nothing; equivalent to `-N` |
| `1` | trace decisions; equivalent to `-d` |
| `2` | trace phases, gds, and decisions; equivalent to `-dpg` |
| `3` | trace productions, phases, and decisions; equivalent to `-dpgP` |
| `4` | trace wmes, productions, phases, and decisions; equivalent to `-dpgPw` |
| `5` | trace preferences, wmes, productions, phases, and decisions; equivalent to `-dpgPwr` |

It is important to note that trace level `0` turns off ALL trace options, including backtracing, indifferent selection and learning. However, the other trace levels do not change these settings. That is, if any of these settings is changed from its default, it will retain its new setting until it is either explicitly changed again or the trace level is set to `0`.

### Options
```
trace [options]
```
| **Option Flag** | **Argument to Option** | **Description** |
|:----------------|:-----------------------|:----------------|
| `-l, --level`   | `0` to `5` (see _Trace Levels_ below) | This flag is optional but recommended. Set a specific trace level using an integer `0` to `5`, this is an inclusive operation |
| `-N, --none`    | No argument            | Turns off all printing about Soar's internals, equivalent to `--level 0` |
| `-b, --backtracing` | `remove` (optional)    | Print backtracing information when a chunk or justification is created |
| `-d, --decisions` | `remove` (optional)    | Controls whether state and operator decisions are printed as they are made |
| `-e, --epmem`   | `remove` (optional)    | Print episodic retrieval traces and IDs of newly encoded episodes  |
| `-g, --gds`     | `remove` (optional)    | Controls printing of warnings when a state is removed due to the GDS |
| `-G, --gds-wmes` | `remove` (optional)    | Controls printing of warnings about wme changes to GDS |
| `-i, --indifferent-selection` | `remove` (optional)    | Print scores for tied operators in random indifferent selection mode |
| `-p, --phases`  | `remove` (optional)    | Controls whether decisions cycle phase names are printed as Soar executes |
| `-r, --preferences` | `remove` (optional)    | Controls whether the preferences generated by the traced productions are printed when those productions fire or retract |
| `-P, --productions` | `remove` (optional)    | Controls whether the names of productions are printed as they fire and retract, equivalent to `-Dujc` |
| `-R, --rl`      | `remove` (optional)    | Print RL debugging output |
| `-s, --smem`    | `remove` (optional)    | Print log of semantic memory storage events |
| `-w, --wmes`    | `remove` (optional)    | Controls the printing of working memory elements that are added and deleted as productions are fired and retracted. |
| `-a, --wma`     | `remove` (optional)    | Print log of working memory activation events  |
| `-A, --assertions` | `remove` (optional)    | Print assertions of rule instantiations and the preferences they generate. |

When appropriate, a specific option may be turned off using the `remove` argument. This argument has a numeric alias; you can use `0` for `remove`. A mix of formats is acceptable, even in the same command line.

#### Tracing Productions

By default, the names of the productions are printed as each production fires and retracts (at trace levels `3` and higher). However, it may be more helpful to trace only a specific _type_ of production. The tracing of firings and retractions of productions can be limited to only certain types by the use of the following flags:

| **Option Flag** | **Argument to Option** | **Description** |
|:----------------|:-----------------------|:----------------|
| `-D, --default` | `remove` (optional)    | Control only default-productions as they fire and retract |
| `-u, --user`    | `remove` (optional)    | Control only user-productions as they fire and retract |
| `-c, --chunks`  | `remove` (optional)    | Control only chunks as they fire and retract |
| `-j, --justifications` | `remove` (optional)    | Control only justifications as they fire and retract |
| `-T, --template` | `remote` (optional)    | Soar-RL template firing trace |

**Note:** The [production watch](cmd_production) command is used to trace individual productions specified by name rather than trace a type of productions, such as `--user`.

Additionally, when tracing productions, users may set the level of detail to be displayed for WMEs that are added or retracted as productions fire and retract. Note that detailed information about WMEs will be printed only for productions that are being traced.

| **Option Flag** | **Description** |
|:--------------|:--------------|
| `-n, --nowmes` | When tracing productions, do not print any information about matching wmes |
| `-t, --timetags` | When tracing productions, print only the timetags for matching wmes |
| `-f, --fullwmes` | When tracing productions, print the full matching wmes |

#### Tracing Learning

| **Option Flag** | **Argument to Option** | **Description** |
|:----------------|:-----------------------|:----------------|
| `-L, --learning` | `noprint`, `print`, or `fullprint` (see table below) | Controls the printing of chunks/justifications as they are created |

As Soar is running, it may create justifications and chunks which are added to production memory. The trace command allows users to monitor when chunks and justifications are created by specifying one of the following arguments to the `--learning` command:

| **Argument** | **Alias** | **Effect** |
|:-------------|:----------|:-----------|
| `noprint`    | `0`       | Print nothing about new chunks or justifications (default) |
| `print`      | `1`       | Print the names of new chunks and justifications when created |
| `fullprint`  | `2`       | Print entire chunks and justifications when created |

### Description

The `trace` command controls the amount of information that is printed out as Soar runs. The basic functionality of this command is to trace various _levels_ of information about Soar's internal workings. The higher the _level_, the  more information is printed as Soar runs. At the lowest setting, `0` (`--none`), nothing is printed. The levels are cumulative, so that each successive level prints the information from the previous level as well as some additional information. The default setting for the _level_ is `1`, (`--decisions`).

The numerical arguments _inclusively_ turn on all levels up to the number specified. To use numerical arguments to turn off a level, specify a number which is less than the level to be turned off. For instance, to turn off tracing of productions, specify `--level 2` (or 1 or 0). Numerical arguments are provided for shorthand convenience. For more detailed control over the trace settings, the named arguments should be used.

With no arguments, this command prints information about the current trace status, i.e., the values of each parameter.

For the named arguments, including the named argument turns on only that setting. To turn off a specific setting, follow the named argument with `remove` or `0`.

The named argument `--productions` is shorthand for the four arguments `--default`, `--user`, `--justifications`, and `--chunks`.

### Examples

The most common uses of trace are by using the numeric arguments which indicate trace levels. To turn off all printing of Soar internals, do any one of the following (not all possibilities listed):

```
trace --level 0
trace -l 0
trace -N
```

Note: You can turn off printing at an even lower level using the `output` command.

Although the `--level` flag is optional, its use is recommended:

```
trace --level 5   ## OK
trace 5           ## OK, avoid
```

Be careful of where the level is on the command line, for example, if you want level 2 and preferences:

```
trace -r -l 2 ## Incorrect: -r flag ignored, level 2 parsed after it and overrides the setting
trace -r 2    ## Syntax error: 0 or remove expected as optional argument to -r
trace -r -l 2 ## Incorrect: -r flag ignored, level 2 parsed after it and overrides the setting
trace 2 -r    ## OK, avoid
trace -l 2 -r ## OK
```

To turn on printing of decisions, phases and productions, do any one of the following (not all possibilities listed):

```
trace --level 3
trace -l 3
trace --decisions --phases --productions
trace -d -p -P
```

Individual options can be changed as well. To turn on printing of decisions and WMEs, but not phases and productions, do any one of the following (not all possibilities listed):

```
trace --level 1 --wmes
trace -l 1 -w
trace --decisions --wmes
trace -d --wmes
trace -w --decisions
trace -w -d
```

To turn on printing of decisions, productions and WMEs, and turns phases off, do any one of the following (not all possibilities listed):

```
trace --level 4 --phases remove
trace -l 4 -p remove
trace -l 4 -p 0
trace -d -P -w -p remove
```

To trace the firing and retraction of decisions and _only_ user productions, do any one of the following (not all possibilities listed):

```
trace -l 1 -u
trace -d -u
```

To trace decisions, phases and all productions _except_ user productions and justifications, and to see full WMEs, do any one of the following (not all possibilities listed):

```
trace --decisions --phases --productions --user remove --justifications remove --fullwmes
trace -d -p -P -f -u remove -j 0
trace -f -l 3 -u 0 -j 0
```
