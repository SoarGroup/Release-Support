## run

Begin Soar's execution cycle.

#### Synopsis

```
run -[d|e|o|p][g][u|n][s] [count] [-i e|p|d|o]
```

### Options

| **Option** | **Description** |
|:-----------|:----------------|
| `-d, --decision` | Run Soar for count decision cycles. |
| `-e, --elaboration` | Run Soar for count elaboration cycles. |
| `-o, --output`   | Run Soar until the nth time output is generated by the agent. Limited by the value of [max-nil-output-cycles](cmd_max_nil_output_cycles). |
| `-p, --phase`    | Run Soar by phases. A phase is either an input phase, proposal phase, decision phase, apply phase, or output phase. |
| `-s, --self`     | If other agents exist within the kernel, do not run them at this time. |
| `-u, --update`   | Sets a flag in the update event callback requesting that an environment updates. This is the default if `--self` is not specified. |
| `-n, --noupdate` | Sets a flag in the update event callback requesting that an environment does not update. This is the default if `--self` is specified. |
| `count`          | A single integer which specifies the number of cycles to run Soar. |
| `-i, --interleave` | Support round robin execution across agents at a finer grain than the run-size parameter. `e` = elaboration, `p` = phase, `d` = decision, `o` = output |
| `-g, --goal`     | Run agent until a goal retracts     |

#### Deprecated Run Options:

These may be reimplemented in the future.

| **Option** | **Description** |
|:-----------|:----------------|
| `--operator` | Run Soar until the nth time an operator is selected. |
| `--state`    | Run Soar until the nth time a state is selected.     |

### Description

The `run` command starts the Soar execution cycle or continues any execution that was temporarily stopped. The default behavior of run, with no arguments, is to cause Soar to execute until it is halted or interrupted by an action of a production, or until an external interrupt is issued by the user. The `run` command can also specify that Soar should run only for a specific number of Soar cycles or phases (which may also be prematurely stopped by a production action or the [stop-soar](cmd_stop_soar) command). This is helpful for debugging sessions, where users may want to pay careful attention to the specific productions that are firing and retracting.

The `run` command takes optional arguments: an integer, `count`, which specifies how many units to run; and a `units` flag indicating what steps or increments to use. If `count` is specified, but no `units` are specified, then Soar is run by decision cycles. If `units` are specified, but `count` is unpecified, then `count` defaults to '1'. If both are unspecified, Soar will run until either a `halt` is executed, an interrupt is received, or max stack depth is reached.

If there are multiple Soar agents that exist in the same Soar process, then issuing a run command in any agent will cause all agents to run with the same set of parameters, unless the flag `--self` is specified, in which case only that agent will execute.

If an environment is registered for the kernel's update event, then when the event it triggered, the environment will get information about how the run was executed. If a run was executed with the `--update` option, then then event sends a flag requesting that the environment actually update itself. If a run was executed with the --noupdate option, then the event sends a flag requesting that the environment not update itself. The `--update` option is the default when run is specified without the `--self` option is not specified. If the `--self` option is specified, then the `--noupdate` option is on by default. It is up to the environment to check for these flags and honor them.

Some use cases include:

| **Option** | **Description** |
|:-----------|:----------------|
| `run --self` | runs one agent but not the environment |
| `run --self --update` | runs one agent and the environment     |
| `run`        | runs all agents and the environment    |
| `run --noupdate` | runs all agents but not the environment |

### Setting an interleave size

When there are multiple agents running within the same process, it may be useful to keep agents more closely aligned in their execution cycle than the run increment (`--elaboration, --phases, --decisions, --output`) specifies. For instance, it may be necessary to keep agents in "lock step" at the phase level, even though the run command issued is for 5 decisions. Some use cases include:

| **Option** | **Description** |
|:-----------|:----------------|
| `run -d 5 -i p` | run the agent one phase and then move to the next agent, looping over agents until they have run for 5 decision cycles |
| `run -o 3 -i d` | run the agent one decision cycle and then move to the next agent. When an agent generates output for the 3rd time, it no longer runs even if other agents continue. |

The `interleave` parameter must always be equal to or smaller than the specified run parameter.

#### Note

If Soar has been stopped due to a `halt` action, an [init-soar](cmd_init_soar) command must be issued before Soar can be restarted with the run command.
