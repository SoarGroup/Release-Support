### output command-to-file

This command logs a single command. It is almost equivalent to opening a log using [clog](cmd_clog), running the command, then closing the log, the only difference is that input isn't recorded.

Running this command while a log is open is an error. There is currently not support for multiple logs in the command line interface, and this would be an instance of multiple logs.

This command echoes output both to the screen and to a file, just like clog.

#### Options:
| **Option** | **Description** |
|:-----------|:----------------|
| `-a, --append` | Append if file exists. |
| `filename`     | The file to log the results of the command to |
| `command`      | The command to log     |
| `args`         | Arguments for command  |

### output log

The `output log` command allows users to save all user-interface input and output to a file. When Soar is logging to a file, everything typed by the user and everything printed by Soar is written to the file (in addition to the screen).

Invoke `output log` with no arguments to query the current logging status. Pass a filename to start logging to that file (relative to the command line interface's home directory). Use the `close` option to stop logging.

#### Usage

```
output log [-A] filename
output log --add string
output log --close
```

#### Options:

| **Option** | **Description** |
|:-----------|:----------------|
| `filename` | Open filename and begin logging. |
| `-c, --close` | Stop logging, close the file.    |
| `-a, --add string` | Add the given string to the open log file. |
| `-A, --append` | Opens existing log file named `filename` and logging is added at the end of the file. |

#### Examples

To initiate logging and place the record in foo.log:

```
output log foo.log
```

To append log data to an existing foo.log file:

```
output log -A foo.log
```

To terminate logging and close the open log file:

```
output log -c
```

#### Known Issues with log

Does not log everything when structured output is selected.

### General Output Settings

Invoke a sub-command with no arguments to query the current setting. Partial commands are accepted.

| **Option** | **Valid Values** | **Default** |
|:-----------|:-----------------|:------------|
| `echo-commands` | yes or no | off |
| `print-depth` | >= 1 | 1 |
| `verbose` | yes or no | no |
| `warnings` | yes or no | yes |

#### output agent-logs

A Soar agent has 100 log channels available. By default, all are turned on. The `log` RHS-function allows printing as with the `write` function, but limits output to only the specified log channel. 

#### output echo-commands

`output echo-commands` will echo typed commands to other connected debuggers. Otherwise, the output is displayed without the initiating command, and this can be confusing.

#### output print-depth

The `print-depth` command reflects the default depth used when working memory elements are printed (using the [print](cmd_print)). The default value is 1. This default depth can be overridden on any particular call to the [print](cmd_print) command by explicitly using the `--depth` flag, e.g. `print --depth 10 args`.

By default, the [print](cmd_print) command prints _objects_ in working memory, not just the individual working memory element. To limit the output to individual working memory elements, the `--internal` flag must also be specified in the [print](cmd_print) command. Thus when the print depth is `0`, by default Soar prints the entire object, which is the same behavior as when the print depth is `1`. But if `--internal` is also specified, then a depth of `0` prints just the individual WME, while a depth of `1` prints all WMEs which share that same identifier. This is true when printing timetags, identifiers or WME patterns.

When the depth is greater than `1`, the identifier links from the specified WME's will be followed, so that additional substructure is printed. For example, a depth of `2` means that the object specified by the identifier, wme-pattern, or timetag will be printed, along with all other objects whose identifiers appear as values of the first object. This may result in multiple copies of the same object being printed out. If `--internal` is also specified, then individuals WMEs and their timetags will be printed instead of the full objects.

#### output verbose

The `verbose` command enables tracing of a number of low-level Soar execution details during a run. The details printed by `verbose` are usually only valuable to developers debugging Soar implementation details.

#### output warnings

The `warnings` command enables and disables the printing of warning messages. At startup, warnings are initially enabled. If warnings are disabled using this command, then some warnings may still be printed, since some are considered too important to ignore.

The warnings that are printed apply to the syntax of the productions, to notify the user when they are not in the correct syntax. When a lefthand side error is discovered (such as conditions that are not linked to a common state or impasse object), the production is generally loaded into production memory anyway, although this production may never match or may seriously slow down the matching process. In this case, a warning would be printed only if warnings were `on`.  Righthand side errors, such as preferences that are not linked to the state, usually result in the production not being loaded, and a warning regardless of the warnings setting.
