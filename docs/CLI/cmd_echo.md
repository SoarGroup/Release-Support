## echo

Print a string to the current output device.

### Synopsis

```
echo [--nonewline] [string]
```

### Options

| **Option** | **Description** |
|:-----------|:----------------|
| `string` | The string to print. |
| `-n, --nonewline` | Supress printing of the newline character |

### Description

This command echos the args to the current output stream. This is normally stdout but can be set to a variety of channels. If an arg is `--nonewline` then no newline is printed at the end of the printed strings. Otherwise a newline is printed after printing all the given args. Echo is the easiest way to add user comments or identification strings in a log file.

### Example

This example will add these comments to the screen and any open log file.

```
echo This is the first run with disks = 12
```
