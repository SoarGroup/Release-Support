() Bug fixes
    - Added work-around for TCL backwards-compatibility issue.  When Tcl mode was 
      enabled in Soar 9.6.0, Soar would not perform alias replacement in sourced 
      files.  As a result, Soar was not performing the backwards compatibility
      replacements and would return an error if the the sourced files contained 
      any commands that no longer existed in 9.6.0.
    - Fixed bug that could occur when retrieving long-term semantic memories
      with over 100 augmentations.  In those cases, the most highly activated
      memory may not have been returned.  (Cases < 100, should have been fine.
      Some special purpose code kicks in when there are that many augmentations
      to a single LTI.)
          
() Low-level architectural changes, code clean-up and refactoring
