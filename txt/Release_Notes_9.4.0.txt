Soar 9.4 Release Notes, June 2014
===================================

This release of Soar continues the 9.3 line. It includes the ability to
include search control knowledge into chunks, a new form of integrated
Tcl support, improved episodic and semantic memory and a large
assortment of bug fixes and user interface enhancements.  All learning
mechanisms are disabled by default.

Soar can be downloaded by following the download link on the Soar home
page at:

        http://sitemaker.umich.edu/soar

Soar releases include source code, demo programs, and a number of
applications that serve as examples of how to interface Soar to an
external environment.  There is support for integrating Soar with C++,
Java, Tcl and Python applications.  Many tools that aid in development
of Soar programs are also available.  The newly expanded download
section of the wiki allows you to browse and download all of the
different distributions, tools and agents.

Important Changes for 9.4
===========================

(1) By default, chunk names use a new naming scheme. They are now based on the rule that created the result rather than type of impasse.

    For example, in Soar 9.3.2 a chunk may be named

    'chunk*impasse*state*no*change*3'

    while in Soar 9.3.3, it would be called something like

    'chunk*apply-create-result*d3-2'

    - That name indicates (a) that the rule 'apply-create-result' is the matched rule which resulted in the chunk, (b) that it was created at decision cycle 3 and (c) was the second chunk created at that decision cycle.

    - Note that if a chunk is created based on another chunk, the prefix of the chunk-name will be something like chunk-2*apply-create-result*d12-1, instead of chunk-chunk*apply-create-result*d12-1.

    - The chunk naming scheme can be changed back to the old mechanism via the command...
    
Bug Fixes
=========

() Fixed bug where using multiple printing functions that used the agent's temporary string buffer would produce incorrect, duplicate output.  Printing functions that used that buffer now use output manager version that rotates between several string buffers.

Technical Changes
=================
Note: Github has trouble displaying history for files that are moved or renamed.  For example, if you look at the SVS history on github's web interface, you'll see only one commit.  The commit history on the actual SVS folder does exist in the repository but is not viewable on github.  This is a known github limitation that they are apparently working on.  Other git interfaces, like the one in Eclipse, are also be affected.  Using the command line or a more robust interface like SourceTree will allow you to see the full history of commits for those files and directories.

() Standardized formatting for all C++ files.
    - Fixed all non-unix line feeds
() Symbol refactoring
    - "common" macro eliminated. Easier for debugging.

() Removed crusty code
    - Removed all USE_MACROS, USE_TCL, and _cplusplus deprecated code blocks.

() Standardized some conventions
    - Removed Bool typecast and standardized to built-in bool.
    - Removed use of TRUE/FALSE and standardized to built-in true/false.  
    - Consolidated all agent params to thisAgent

() Reorganized some code
    - Moved random functions from utilities to better places.  
    - Added test.cpp, stats.cpp, rhs.cpp
    - Eliminated gdatastructs.h, utilities.h
    - Renamed io.soar to io_soar to match its header file
