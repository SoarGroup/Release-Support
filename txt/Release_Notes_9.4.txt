    - That name indicates (a) that the rule 'apply-create-result' is the matched rule which resulted in the chunk, (b) that it was created at decision cycle 3 and (c) was the second chunk created at that decision cycle.

    - Note that if a chunk is created based on another chunk, the prefix of the chunk-name will be something like chunk-2*apply-create-result*d12-1, instead of chunk-chunk*apply-create-result*d12-1.

    - The chunk naming scheme can be changed back to the old mechanism via the command...
