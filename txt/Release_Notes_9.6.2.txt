Soar 9.6.2 Release Notes, 2023
===========================================

This release of Soar includes mostly quality of life improvements, but also many
bug fixes and code improvements.

=================
New Features
=================
() More ergonomic RHS and client message handler registration
    9.6.1 changed the interfaces for AddRhsFunction and RegisterForClientMessageEvent
    significantly, making them difficult to use. 9.6.2 adds new overloads utilizing
    std::function to simplify usage in C++ clients. Clients using class methods for handlers
    will no longer need to pass the class instance separately as (void*)userData, and can
    instead simply pass in the result of std::bind.

() Better dark mode styling for the debugger
    Previous versions of the debugger were very difficult to read on Mac in dark mode due
    to displaying black text on a dark background. The text now correctly shows as white.

=================
Other Changes
=================

() Bug fixes
    - `smem --init` now connects to the DB so that a following `smem --clear` will not error out.
    - `smem -x ...` when the DB is not yet loaded now fails gracefully (instead of segfaulting)
    - Improved stability of Python SML bindings
    - SoarCLI now properly exits on EOF. This means that it can be gracefully exited with
        Ctrl-D, and it no longer hangs when reading from a pipe.

() Infrastructure improvements
    - CI now runs Python SML tests

() Cruft and cleanup
    - stopped exporting a large number of internal SML classes to SWIG clients
    - documented portability requirements for building SWIG clients
    - eliminated potentially dangerous pointer size warnings from CSharp SML bindings
