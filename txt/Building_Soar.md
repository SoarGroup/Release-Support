=============
Building Soar
=============

If you would like to build Soar from source, you will first need to download the source code
from [GitHub](https://github.com/SoarGroup/Soar). Then, look at the setup and build steps run
by our CI system in the `.github/workflows/build.yml` file. We build for all major platforms.

The final Soar distribution that you have downloaded here is built using tools in a separate
repository called [Release-Support](https://github.com/SoarGroup/Release-Support).
