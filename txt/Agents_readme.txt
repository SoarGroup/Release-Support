# Soar 9.6.0 Demo Agents
# April 2017
# 
# Classic AI problems implemented for Soar 9
#
# Arithmetic:
#    Does multicolumn addition and subtraction using simple
#    addition facts. Automatically generates, solves, and verifies
#    1000 problems. Demonstrates hierarchical task decomposition
#    and chunking over the decomposition. 
# Blocks-World: Stack blocks
#    Demonstrates means-ends analysis, operator-subgoaling, and look-ahead
# Eight-Puzzle: Sliding tile puzzle.
#    Demonstrates look-ahead search and chunking.
#    Has graphical interface
# EpMem-Tutorial
#    A simple agent that shows how structures are stored in episodic
#    memory and then retrieved.
# Hello-world: simplest example of Soar rules and operators
# Left-right: 
#    Trivial example for RL.
# MAC: Missionaries and Cannibals
#    Has multiple version using look-ahead search 
#    and chunking showing tradeoffs in state representations for
#    operator application vs. state copying.
# Towers-of-hanoi: Classic disk and peg problem
#    Two strategies implemented - no search or learning.
#    Multiple implementations of one of the strategies using 
#    different representations with different generality and different
#    execution costs
# SMem-Tutorial
#    A simple agent that shows how structures are stored in semantic
#    memory and then retrieved.
# Water-jug:
#    Has two versions which use look-ahead search 
#    and chunking showing tradeoffs in state representations for
#    operator application vs. state copying.
#    Another version with simple evaluation in tie subgoal (water-jug-tie)
#    water-jug-rl works with RL.
#    
# Default:
#    Holds rules used for implementing common problem solving
#    strategies including look-ahead search and operator subgoaling.
