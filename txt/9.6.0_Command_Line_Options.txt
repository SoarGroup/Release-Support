Soar-CLI Command Line Options
-----------------------------
    -l            Listen on, i.e. launches Soar kernel in new thread
    -n            No syntax coloring (speeds things up, also Windows doesn't support our color code)
    -p <port>     Listens on port <port>
    -s <file>     Sources file <file> on load

To manage multiple agents, you can use the commands "create", "list", and "switch".  These are Soar-CLI commands, not native Soar commands.

Soar Java Debugger Command Line Options
---------------------------------------
    -remote             Use a remote connection (with default ip and port values)
    -ip xxx             Use this IP value (implies remote connection)
    -port ppp           Use this port (implies remote connection, without any remote options we start a local kernel)
    -agent <name>       On a remote connection select this agent as initial agent
    -agent <name>       On a local connection use this as the name of the initial agent
    -source <path>      Load this file of productions on launch (only valid for local kernel)
    -quitonfinish       When combined with source causes the debugger to exit after sourcing that one file
    -listen ppp         Use this port to listen for remote connections (only valid for a local kernel)
    -maximize           Start with maximized window
    -width <width>      Start with this window width
    -height <height>    Start with this window height
    -x <x> -y <y>       Start with this window position
    -cascade            Cascade each window that starts (offseting from the -x <x> -y <y> if given). This option now always on. (Providing width/height/x/y => not a maximized window)

Troubleshooting
---------------
    
    If you have problems with the debugger, try deleting any .soar* files in your home directory.  Corrupt settings can cause the java debugger to fail to launch.
