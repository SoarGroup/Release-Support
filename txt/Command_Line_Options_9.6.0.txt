Soar Java Debugger Command Line Options

    -ip xxx             Use this IP value (implies remote connection)
    -port ppp           Use this port (implies remote connection, without any remote options we start a local kernel)
    -agent <name>       On a remote connection select this agent as initial agent
    -agent <name>       On a local connection use this as the name of the initial agent
    -source <path>      Load this file of productions on launch (only valid for local kernel)
    -quitonfinish       When combined with source causes the debugger to exit after sourcing that one file
    -listen ppp         Use this port to listen for remote connections (only valid for a local kernel)
    -maximize           Start with maximized window
    -width <width>      Start with this window width
    -height <height>    Start with this window height
    -x <x> -y <y>       Start with this window position
    -cascade            Cascade each window that starts (offseting from the -x <x> -y <y> if given). This option now always on. (Providing width/height/x/y => not a maximized window)
