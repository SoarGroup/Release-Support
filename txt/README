=========================

Welcome to Soar!  Soar 9.6.0 is the current, stable version of Soar. It is the 
first major release in a few years and includes six key new features and 
hundreds of important bug fixes and code improvements:

- Explanation-Based Chunking: â€‹ The first official release of a new, far more
powerful rule learning algorithm that replaces chunking, Soar's original general
learning mechanism

- Instance-based model of semantic memory: Can be used in a greater variety of
ways and integrates with other aspects of Soar much more cleanly

- Streamlined user interface: Has far fewer top-level commands with improved
presentation and feedback

- Explanations: A new explain command provides interactive exploration of an
agent's rule learning experiences

- Visualizations: A new visualize command creates graphical representations of
Soar's memory systems and even some of its processing

- Spreading activation: The first beta release of a model of spreading activation
in semantic memory

The full release notes can be found in its own file.

Official Soar Manual
====================

To facilitate continual updating and improvement of the Soar manual, it is no
longer distributed as part of the binary release.  The latest version can be
found at:

=========
Launching
=========

- Navigate to the folder you extracted to
- Launch Soar
  - To launch Soar within a graphical user interface
    - Windows users, run SoarJavaDebugger.bat
    - Linux and Mac users, run SoarJavaDebugger.sh
  - To launch Soar using a command line interface,
    - Windows users, run Soar_CLI.bat
    - Linux and Mac users, run Soar_CLI.sh
    - You can also navigate to the /bin directory in a terminal and run the Soar executable directly

Launch options for the CLI and the java debugger are listed at the bottom of this document.

=============================
Soar-CLI Command Line Options
=============================
    -l            Listen on, i.e. launches Soar kernel in new thread
    -n            No syntax coloring (for people on light background or on 
                  Windows, which doesn't support our color codes.  Also turning 
                  off color does speed up printing.)
    -p <port>     Listens on port <port>
    -s <file>     Sources file <file> on load

To manage multiple agents, you can use the commands "create", "list", and 
"switch".  These are Soar-CLI commands, not native Soar commands.  They are 
not available in other interfaces, for example the Soar Java Debugger.

=======================================
Soar Java Debugger Command Line Options
=======================================
    -remote             Use a remote connection (with default ip/port)
    -ip xxx             Use this IP value (implies remote connection)
    -port ppp           Use this port (implies remote connection, without any 
                        remote options we start a local kernel)
    -agent <name>       On a remote connection select this agent as initial 
                        agent
    -agent <name>       On a local connection use this as the name of the 
                        initial agent
    -source <path>      Load this file of productions on launch (only valid 
                        for local kernel)
    -quitonfinish       When combined with source causes the debugger to exit 
                        after sourcing that one file
    -listen ppp         Use this port to listen for remote connections (only 
                        valid for a local kernel)
    -maximize           Start with maximized window
    -width <width>      Start with this window width
    -height <height>    Start with this window height
    -x <x> -y <y>       Start with this window position
    -cascade            Cascade each window that starts (offseting from the 
                        -x <x> -y <y> if given). This option now always on. 
                        Note that providing width/height/x/y => not a maximized 
                        window.

If you have problems with the debugger, try deleting any .soar* files in your 
home directory.  Corrupt settings can cause the java debugger to fail to launch.

===================================================
Transitioning To Soar 9.6.0's New Command Structure
===================================================

The following shows the new command structure for Soar 9.6.0 and how the 
commands from previous versions of Soar map to it. All of the new commands
and their sub-commands will guess the command based on partial input.

Note:  Soar 9.6.0 translates old commands in a way that it maintains 99.9% 
       backwards compatibility with 9.5.1, so this transition should not be 
       painful.
