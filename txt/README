=========================

Welcome to Soar!  Soar 9.6.2 is the current, stable version of Soar. It is a maintenance release, meaning no major features were added, but it does still represent a lot of work in the form of bug fixes, code modernization, and usability improvements.

* VisualSoar contains several new features, including custom support for custom templates and a new "find all productions" search option. There's also now a manual included.

* The debugger now supports full-featured log filtering, and the display is now compatible with dark mode. We also include new shortcuts for zooming in and out.

* SoarCLI now exits on EOF, making it possible to control it via pipes (or tools like expect).

* Some Soar warnings and static analyses have been improved to give the user more actionable feedback around malformed rules.

The full release notes can be found in their own file.

Official Soar Manual

The 9.6.2 edition of the Soar Manual is included here for your reference. You can also view it online at:

=========
Launching
=========

- Navigate to the folder you extracted to
- Launch Soar
  - To launch Soar within a graphical user interface
    - Windows users, run SoarJavaDebugger.bat
    - Linux and Mac users, run SoarJavaDebugger.sh
  - To launch Soar using a command line interface,
    - Windows users, run SoarCLI.bat
    - Linux and Mac users, run SoarCLI.sh
    - You can also navigate to the /bin directory in a terminal and run the Soar executable directly. However, users should first run setup.sh or setup.bat to avoid permission and path issues. This is done for you if you use one of the other launch scripts.

Launch options for the CLI and the java debugger are listed at the bottom of this document.

=============================
Soar-CLI Command Line Options
=============================
    -l            Listen on, i.e. launches Soar kernel in new thread
    -n            No syntax coloring (for people on light background or on
                  Windows, which doesn't support our color codes.  Also turning
                  off color does speed up printing.)
    -p <port>     Listens on port <port>
    -s <file>     Sources file <file> on load

To manage multiple agents, you can use the commands "create", "list", and
"switch".  These are Soar-CLI commands, not native Soar commands.  They are
not available in other interfaces, for example the Soar Java Debugger.

=======================================
Soar Java Debugger Command Line Options
=======================================
    -remote             Use a remote connection (with default ip/port)
    -ip xxx             Use this IP value (implies remote connection)
    -port ppp           Use this port (implies remote connection, without any
                        remote options we start a local kernel)
    -agent <name>       On a remote connection select this agent as initial
                        agent
    -agent <name>       On a local connection use this as the name of the
                        initial agent
    -source <path>      Load this file of productions on launch (only valid
                        for local kernel)
    -quitonfinish       When combined with source causes the debugger to exit
                        after sourcing that one file
    -listen ppp         Use this port to listen for remote connections (only
                        valid for a local kernel)
    -maximize           Start with maximized window
    -width <width>      Start with this window width
    -height <height>    Start with this window height
    -x <x> -y <y>       Start with this window position
    -cascade            Cascade each window that starts (offseting from the
                        -x <x> -y <y> if given). This option now always on.
                        Note that providing width/height/x/y => not a maximized
                        window.

If you have problems with the debugger, try deleting any .soar* files in your
home directory.  Corrupt settings can cause the java debugger to fail to launch.

===================================================
Transitioning To Soar 9.6.0's New Command Structure
===================================================

The following shows the new command structure for Soar 9.6.0 and how the
commands from previous versions of Soar map to it. All of the new commands
and their sub-commands will guess the command based on partial input.

Note:  Soar 9.6.0 translates old commands in a way that it maintains 99.9%
       backwards compatibility with 9.5.1, so this transition should not be
       painful.
