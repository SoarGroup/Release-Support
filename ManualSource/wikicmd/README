The gen_tex.sh script will download the CommandLineInterface page on the
google code wiki and translate it into latex files, one for each
command. It first split the single wiki page into one page for each
first level heading, which should demarcate a single command. These
files are kept in the wiki/ subdirectory. Each wiki page is then passed
through moin2latex.py which generates a latex source file in the tex/
subdirectory. These files are referenced and automatically included in
interface-8.6.tex.

The google code wiki syntax is a subset of MoinMoin wiki syntax. The
MoinMoin/ subdirectory contains a stripped down and slightly modified
version of MoinMoin 1.9.3 which is needed to run the moin2latex.py
script. No additional python packages should be needed. Note that
MoinMoin 1.9.3 is only compatible with python versions < 3.0.
